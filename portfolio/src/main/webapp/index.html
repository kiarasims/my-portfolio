      <p> My name is Kiara Sims. I am a upcoming junior Computer Science major at Xavier University of Louisiana
          I was born, partially raised and living in New Orleans. After hurricane Katrina, I moved to Mississippi
          by my grandfather side of the family. I lived in Mississippi until I was in the 7th grade then moved back 
          to New Orleans for the rest of my school years and college.</p>
